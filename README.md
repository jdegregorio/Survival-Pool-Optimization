# NFL Survival Pool Pick Optimization using Genetic Algorithm

## Introduction

### Objective
Optimize the strategy/approach for selecting teams in NFL survival pools.

### General Background
Survivor pools are are sports betting game where each participant in the pool selects just a single team each week that they beleive win. If the selected team loses, the partipapant is eliminated from the pool, if the selected team wins, then the participant advances (i.e. "survives") to the next week.  The participant that survives the longest will win (or split) the prize money.

The catch to this game is that each participant may only select each team *once* the entire season. This presents each participant with an interesting decision.  Shall they select the best teams first, improving the probability of advancing in the first several weeks, or keep some of these teams on reserve for later weeks?

### Additional Complexity
The strategy even becomes more interesting when you consider the following:
  * How might teams power rankings change throughout the season (injuries, etc.)?
  * Will picking the "popular" or "higest-probability" matchup differentiate yourself enough to become the sole remaining survivor?
  * How do multiple entries per participant affect the strategy?
